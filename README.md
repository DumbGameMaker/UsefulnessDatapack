## The most useful datapack ever!
This datapack aims to be the most feature-packed, configurable datapack ever. It is still in development though, so the only place you can download it is from releases.

Please give me a diamond on planetminecraft, it encourages me to keep going and helps the datapack out by bringing attention to it.

## Progress 
1. Ideas
- Flesh to leather and steak?
- Veinminer/TreeCapacitator?
  - Ask permission to use their datapacks
- Cheaty stuff
  - SuperDuperDupeDatapack
  - FreeFly
- Ask the community!
2. Implement
- Flesh to Leather/Steak      | 100%
- Veinminer/TreeCapacitator   | 0%
  - Ask permission            | 0%
  - Implement it!             | 0%
- Cheaty stuff                | 0%
  - My Datapack               | 100%
